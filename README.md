# Introduction 
Interruptible customers in Georgia are not held responsible for not only over-burning but also under-burning. This adjustment to the AGL system prompted Gas South to prioritize providing these customers with their daily reads, so that they can better manage their day-to-day consumption. This solution intends to first solve the need of providing daily usage to each customer in a professional manner. Additional functionality may roll out in the future.
